    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>My kids do not like anything fishy. I snuck this one by them and they loved it. 
        I serve them as snacks, sandwiches, or as dinner with rice and a veggie on the 
        side. Personally I like to dip them in horseradish and snack away!! Hope you 
        like them.</p>
